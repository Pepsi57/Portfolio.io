        <h1>Untitled Android App</h1>
        <p>
            My untitled Anime connection app will be similar to Airbuds. 
            In this app you would be able to see what your friends are watching, 
            chat about anime in the different anime channels, watch anime with your 
            friends in a group watch, and get anime recs from other anime watchers.
        </p>

        <h2>Untitled Idle Game</h2>
        <p>
            The untitled game im working on will be an idle game similiar to the 
            Tycoon games. The actual plot of the game is still being worked out,
            but expect it to be just as fun as all of the other Tycoon games.
        </p>
