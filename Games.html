    <p> Trial by Buyer is a game where you must go around the grocery store and collect all the items on the grocery list in order to leave.
        In order to grab all the items that you need to leave the grocery store, you must solve the riddles (your grocery list) to figure out 
        what items you need. 
    </p>
    <p>In this game I help create 4 out of 5 spaces in the game. I helped with the check-out area, the produce section, the bakery, and the 
        electronics section. I also wrote most of the riddles in the game as well.
